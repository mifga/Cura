[2.3.0]
*Multi Extrusion Support
Machines with multiple extruders are now supported. Ultimaker 3 printers and Ultimaker Original printers with dual extrusion upgrade kit are currently supported.

*Network Printing for Ultimaker 3
Sending a print to an Ultimaker 3 remotely via the network is now possible. Requires Wi-Fi or LAN to connect to the printer.

*Print Monitoring for Ultimaker 3
You can monitor your print on an Ultimaker 3 with a live camera feed. Requires Wi-Fi or LAN to connect to the printer.

*Material and Print Core Synchronization
Connecting to an Ultimaker 3 now gives you the option to synchronize the materials in Cura with what is loaded in the printer.

*Speed improvements
The first thing you will notice is the speed. STL loading is now 10 to 20 times faster, layer view is significantly faster and slicing speed is slightly improved.

*Improved Position Tool
Place objects precisely where you want them by manually entering the values for the position.

*Custom Machine Support
It’s now much easier to use Cura with custom machines. You can edit the machine settings when you load a new custom machine.

*Improved Grouping
It's now possible to transform objects that are already grouped.
Select an individual item in a group or merged object and edit as usual. Just Ctrl + Click and edit away.

*Enhanced Profile Management
Profile management is improved. You can now easily see and track changes made to your profiles.

*Improved Setting Visibility
Make multiple settings visible at the same time with a checkbox. The Visibility Overview setting indicates why a setting is not shown in the sidebar even if it is enabled.

*Improved time estimation
Time estimations are more accurate. Based on our test time estimations should be within 5% accuracy for Ultimaker printers.

*Optional G-code Machine Prefix
Disable the g-code prefix in Preferences. No more UM2_ on your printer display!

*Print Weight Estimates
Cura now estimates print weight as well as length.

*Automatic Import Configuration
Configurations from older installations of Cura 2.1 are automatically imported into the newest installation.

*Slicing features
*Infill Types
Two new infill types are now introduced: Tetrahedral and Cubic. They change along with the Z-axis for more uniform strength in all directions. There are now seven infill types to choose from.

*Gradual Infill
Gradual infill lets users adjust infill density, based on the distance from the top layers. This offers faster printing and reduced material requirements, whilst maintaining surface quality.

*Set Acceleration and Jerk by Feature
You can now set Jerk and Acceleration by feature-type (infill, walls, top/bottom, etc), for more precision.

*Outer Wall Offset
If your outer wall line width is smaller than your nozzle size, move the nozzle a bit inward when printing the outer wall, to improve surface quality.

*Enhanced Combing
The “No Skin” option allows you to comb over infill only to avoid scars on top surfaces.

*Z Hop
Can’t avoid previously printed parts by horizontal moves? The Z Hop Only Over Printed Parts gives you the ability to Z Hop to avoid collisions for better surface quality.

*Skin and Wall Overlap
The Skin Overlap setting allows you to overlap the skin lines with the walls for better adhesion.

*Adjust Initial Layer Travel Speed
Set the travel speed of the initial layer(s) to reduce risk of extruder pulling the print from the bed.

*Support Interface
It is now possible to print a support bottom as well as a support roof. Support bottoms are placed where the support rests on the model. Printing the support interface with PVA leads to improved surface quality.

*Bug fixes
Deleting grouped objects
Duplicating groups
Bridging
Drag and drop (first Windows run)
Unretraction speeds
Bottom layer in Spiralize mode
Overlap Compensation
Raft retractions
Retractions now occur after each object printed in one-at-a-time mode
Rafts are no longer printed outside of build area
Spiralize no longer limited to the first printed segment only
Line distance is now the actual line distance
Enabling raft doesn’t influence at which height the model is sliced any more
Brim is now always printed just once
Support roofs now only occur just below overhang

*Minor changes
Message display time increased to 30 seconds
Notification if you try to save to a locked SD card
Engine log now included in the application log
Undo and Redo now function with multiple operations
The last used folder is now remembered rather than defaulting to home folder
Import X3D files
Made it possible to add multiple Per Model Settings at once
Bed Level and Checkup procedures for UMO+ can be performed without re-adding machine
Combing applied in more cases and results in better paths
Infill thickness now supports Grid infill also for even multiples of the layer height
Support is no longer removed by unprintable thin parts of the model
Support generated on each appropriate layer
Support no longer goes outside overhang areas
Support no longer removes brim around the object
Brim is now also generated under the support
Draft and Ooze shield get their own brim or raft
Settings shared between skirt and brim now also activate when brim is selected
Compensate overlapping wall parts now also works for inner walls
Bed lowering speed can be adjusted for each layer

[2.1.3]

*Material Profiles
New material profiles for CPE+, PC, Nylon and TPU for the Ultimaker 2+ family.

[2.1.2]

Cura has been completely reengineered from the ground up for an even more seamless integration between hardware, software and materials. Together with its intuitive new user interface, it’s now also ready for any future developments. For the beginner Cura makes 3D printing incredibly easy, and for more advanced users, there are over 200 customizable settings.

*Select Multiple Objects
You now have the freedom to select and manipulate multiple objects at the same time.

*Grouping
You can now group objects together to make it easier to manipulate multiple objects.

*Undo/Redo
You can now undo and redo your actions, like moving an object or scaling.

*Setting Profiles
The new GUI allows custom profiles to load easily and intuitively, directly from Cura.

*3MF File Loading Support
We’re happy to report we now support loading 3MF files. This is a new file format similar to AMF, but freely available.

*Intuitive Cut-Off Object Bottom 
We’ve added a feature that allows you to move objects below the build plate. You can either correct a model with a rough bottom, or print only a part of an object. Please note that the implementation differs greatly from the old one when it was just a setting.

*64-bit Windows Builds 
An optimized 64-bit Windows Cura version is now available. This allows you to load larger model files.

*Automatic calculations
Cura allows you to set a number of lines/layers instead of millimeters. The engine automatically calculates the right settings.

*Per-Object Settings
Per-object settings allow you to override individual profile settings per object.

*Engine Features

*Line Width
Line width settings added per feature: Global, Walls, Top/Bottom, Infill, Skirt, Support.

*Pattern Settings
Pattern settings improved per feature: Top/Bottom, Infill, Support.

*Shell

*Alternate Skin Rotation
Helps to combat the pillowing problem on top layers.

*Alternate Extra Wall
For better infill adhesion.

*Horizontal Expansion
Allows to compensate model x,y-size to get a 1:1 result.

*Travel

*Avoid Printed Parts
When moving to the next part to print, avoid collisions between the nozzle and other parts which are already printed.

*Support

*Stair Step Height
Sets the balance between sturdy and hard to remove support. By setting steps of the stair-like bottom of the support resting on the model.

*ZigZag
A new, infill type that’s easily breakable, introduced specially for support.

*Support Roofs
A new sub-feature to reduce scars the support leaves on overhangs.

*Support Towers
Specialized support for tiny overhang areas.

*Special Modes

*Surface Mode
This mode will print the surface of the mesh instead of the enclosed volume. This used to be called ‘Only follow mesh surface’. In addition to the ‘surface mode’ and ‘normal’, a ‘both’ mode has now been added. This ensures all closed volumes are printed as normal and all loose geometry as single walls.

*Experimental Features

*Conical Support
An experimental filament, cost-reduction feature, for support.

*Draft Shield
Prints a protective wall at a set distance around the object that prevents air from hitting the print, reducing warping.

*Fuzzy Skin
Prints the outer walls with a jittering motion to give your object a diffuse finish.

*Wire Printing
The object is printed with a mid-air / net-like structure, following the mesh surface. The build plate will move up and down during diagonal segments. Though not visible in layer view, you can view the result in other software, such as Repetier Host or http://chilipeppr.com/tinyg.
